                For this project, create a C# program that takes in an amount of currency and then
                tells you how many smaller coins would be needed to make up that same value. For
                example, in American currency, there are four different coins that are less than a
                dollar: quarters (worth 25 cents), dimes (worth 10 cents), nickels (worth 5 cents), and
                pennies (worth 1 cent). In the EU, there are 2e, 1e, 50c, 20c, 10c, 5c, 2c, and 1c coins
                respectively.
                Your program should first make sure that the user has entered a positive amount. It
                should then convert the amount to a sum of the smallest possible units, then
                calculate the number of larger units that will make up the original total.
                This problem is an example of what is known as a Greedy algorithm. In a single pass
                through your amount, you are determining at each step the best way to solve the
                problem. In other words, at each stage of the problem, you are attempting to find an
                optimized solution that will lead to the best solution as a whole.
